<p>Contrary to its name, Aga Khan Palace functioned as a prison to Mahatma Gandhi, Kasturba Gandhi and Mahadev Bhai Desai, secretary of Gandhi between August 1942 and May 1944. Aga Khan Palace, though, had other purposes when Sultan Muhammed Shah Aga Khan III built it in the year 1892. It was built with a view to help those in neighborhood who suffered the worst effects of famine. Aga Khan the Fourth donated this palace to the people of the country as a mark of respect to Mahatma Gandhi. A fine specimen for architectural excellence with lush greenery around, the palace is frequented by tourists to visit Gandhi’s memorial and memorials of Kasturba and Gandhi’s secretary who breathed their last here.</p>

<h2>5.Rajgad Fort</h2>
<img src="fort1.jpeg" width=45%>
<p>At a height of 4600 feet stands Rajgad fort, which served as Shivaji’s capital for more than 25 years. Trekking Rajgad can be a memorable experience as it is highly adventurous. The views from the top are stunning. To do justice to yourself and the fort after having trekked so high, it would be a better idea to camp here overnight so that you can thoroughly explore the fort the following morning. The fort houses two temples where camping facilities are provided. The fort had been a witness to many historical events and if you have a strong memory where history is concerned, the place should impress upon you most.</p>

<p>Located at the heart of the city, Lal Mahal, the red brick structure appeals to you the moment you set your eyes on it. The impressive palace was constructed in 1643 AD by Dadaji, father of emperor Shivaji, for his wife and son. This is where Shivaji lived until he won over the first fort. The place is a witness to the incident when Shivaji cut the fingers of Shaistekhan. The walls of the palace are decorated with paintings that depict some of the important events in the life of Shivaji.</p>

<h2>7.Raja Dinkar Kelkar Museum</h2>
<img src="museum.jpg" width=45%>
<p>The Raja Dinkar Kelkar Museum reflects the spirit of the sole man behind the overwhelming number of collections of artworks from various parts of India. Dr. D.G. Kelkar, the man behind it, dedicated the museum to the memory of Raja, his only son, who had died tragically. This is the second largest museum in the country if you go by the numbers of museums that have been established and contributed to by individuals. The 21000 plus collections here represent various eras, races, cultures and traditions in the country. Musical instruments, wooden objects, writing materials, paintings, coins, textiles, arms, sculptures, ivory items and various other collections give you a glimpse into the past and at the same time you cannot but applaud the relentless efforts of the collector.</p>

<h2>8.The Empress Garden</h2>
<img src="garden.jpg" width=45%>
<p>Monuments and other ancient constructions not only remind you of the mighty ancestors that belonged to your part of the world but they are also reminders of the downfall of the mighty and the supremacy of the victor who came from other land to fight, conquer and rule. The Empress Garden set in a sprawling 39 acre of land, though stunningly beautiful is a reminder of the rule of the British and their power, which was so overpowering that they named the garden after Queen Victoria when she was given the title ‘Empress of India’. The garden is frequented by tourists as the landscape is stunningly beautiful. Agri-Horticultural Society manages the garden with a view to preserve the region’s wide range of flowers. Many rare trees and flowers are seen here. Annual flower shows conducted here attract visitors from far off places. Jogging facility and play area for children are other added features of the park.</p>

<p>How would you love to view the earth from 4300 feet above sea level and particularly if you happened to be by a formidable fort? If the prospect is inviting, visit Sinhagad Fort on Sahyadri Hills from where you can have a stunning view of lush greenery, beautiful waterfalls and enjoy the tranquility. It was here in this fort where Rajaram, the younger son of Shivaji, passed away.
